Notes and Weather

Notes and Weather is a UWP app that allows the user to take notes at various locations and to view the weather forecast for that location. The app has been created as part of my college coursework. 

The brief of the project requires the use of local storage and at least one of the devices sensors. 

The app makes use of the openweathermap.org API to retrieve weather data for a location. This fulfills the project brief in that the device's location sensor is used.

The notes feature uses full CRUD functionality, whereby notes are stored in the user device's local storage, thereby fulfilling the project brief.

In creating this app I referred to tutorials by Bob Tabor which can be found at:
